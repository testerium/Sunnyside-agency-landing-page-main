## My process

This is my first junior level project using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript. It had many sections that required spending some time. There were no problems with the implementation of the visible part of the project. The project is responsive, I designed views for laptop, tablet and mobile. The challenge was the implementation of the menu based on JavaScript in mobile view, but finally it was implemented successfully.
